# FE-Assignment-BONO

This project, developed as a test assignment for Bono, demonstrates a comprehensive application of modern web development practices using Next.js and React. The project integrates various technologies and techniques to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface. Key highlights include:

- API Integration: Efficient fetching and rendering of data from Bono’s API endpoints, ensuring real-time updates and accurate data representation.

- Tailwind CSS for Styling: Leveraging Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design, ensuring consistency across different screen sizes.

- Icon Toggle Feature: Implementation of a seamless icon toggle functionality that enhances user interaction by changing icons upon user actions.

- Interactive Components: Creating interactive and stateful components using React’s hooks, enhancing the user experience by providing real-time feedback and updates.

- The Open Graph Protocol: Utilization of The Open Graph protocol to improve the integration with social media platforms, enhancing content sharing and visibility.

This project not only showcases the technical prowess in handling complex front-end development tasks but also reflects a keen eye for detail and user experience design, making it a robust and scalable solution.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
